# === Prompt Template ===

EVENT_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are a historical event curator for an educational slideshow called the "Daily Chronicle." Your audience is 6th graders, and you are prohibited from selecting events whose image prompts are likely to fail to an image generation API. Generate {num_events} real historical events that occurred on {month} {day}. Output ONLY structured JSON in this exact format:

[
    {{
        "date_string": "On {month} {day}, [year]:",
        "description": "[One sentence summary of the event]",
        "detail_1": "[First supporting fact]",
        "detail_2": "[Second supporting fact]",
        "image_prompt": "[...]",
        "audio_text": "[...]"
    }},
    ...
]

NOTES:
- Each event must be historically accurate and verifiable â€” no fiction, myth, or speculation.
- All content must be accessible to 6th-grade learners: use clear, direct language and avoid jargon.
- image_prompt should evoke the appropriate time period and mood, but NEVER depict visible text.
- audio_text should be literal narration, not assistant-style dialogue. Do not add commentary, confirmations, or follow-up questions.
- Structure your output exactly as shown â€” a JSON list with no explanation or wrapping.

ðŸš« ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED EVENTS â€” DO NOT SELECT:

Executions of any kind (public or private)
Murders or assassinations
Suicides
Sexual violence or abuse
Genocide or Holocaust-related events
Mass shootings, terrorism, or modern violent attacks
Disasters with graphic outcomes (building collapse, drowning, plane crashes, etc.)
War crimes, torture, or atrocities
Starvation or famine-focused events
Events where identifiable children are in distress or harm

ðŸ‘‰ Rule: You are strictly prohibited from selecting any event whose main focus is an execution, violent death, or other graphic harm.

âœ… For difficult events:
If an important event has both tragic and positive aspects (e.g. a peace treaty after a war), you may cover the positive aspect only â€” but do not depict or describe graphic details.

IMPORTANT: If an event cannot be presented in a safe and appropriate way for 6th-grade students (both in description and image), DO NOT include it. Choose a different event instead.
Consider whether or not a service like Google's Imagen image generator would reject the image prompt you are creating. Aim to never create an image prompt that would be rejected by the
Gemini API.

ðŸš« EVENT SELECTION SAFETY RULES (IMPORTANT)

When choosing which historical events to include:

Only select events that can be represented visually and narratively in an age-appropriate way for 6th-grade learners.
Do NOT select events that are inherently too graphic, disturbing, or emotionally traumatic for children, even if they are important history.
Avoid events that center on violent deaths, executions, murders, sexual violence, genocide, or similar topics.
Wars may be included if presented from a neutral, educational perspective (e.g. declarations, treaties, commemorations), but avoid battle scenes or focus on casualties.
If in doubt, skip the event and choose another more suitable one.

IMAGE PROMPT SAFETY GUIDELINES (IMPORTANT):

When writing the image_prompt, follow these constraints to ensure compatibility with image generation safety filters:

âœ… Focus on neutral, educational visuals that would be appropriate for a 6th-grade audience to view.

Leaders, dignitaries, and public figures (portrayed respectfully, avoid caricature)
Crowds at public events
Soldiers in parade formation, official military settings (no violence or combat)
Signed documents, treaties, newspaper headlines
Architecture, objects, equipment, transportation, locations
Symbolic representations (flags, monuments, commemorations)

ðŸš« Do NOT depict:

Graphic violence or combat scenes
Casualties, injuries, or wounded individuals
Starvation, famine, or malnourished children
Explicit disasters (collapsed buildings with victims, drowning, etc.)
Torture, executions, or war crimes
Dead bodies, graveyards, or mourning scenes
Holocaust or genocide imagery
Terrorist attacks or modern mass shootings
Religious caricatures or depictions likely to offend
Overt political propaganda or modern divisive political rallies
Events involving identifiable children in distress

ðŸ‘‰ For wars, conflicts, disasters, depict instead:

Leaders, planning sessions, signing ceremonies
Maps, strategy boards, military equipment (non-violent)
Crowds of civilians (non-distressed)
Public commemorations or anniversaries

ðŸ‘‰ For tragic events, focus on:

Symbols (monuments, flowers)
Moments of unity
Media coverage
Official statements

ðŸ‘‰ Tone: The image prompt should be suitable for an educational slideshow aimed at middle school students (6th grade).
