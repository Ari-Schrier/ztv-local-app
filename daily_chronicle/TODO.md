# TODO - Daily Chronicle Generator

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- Notebook successfully refactored into modular Python code.
- Core modules:
    - `main.py` (CLI runner)
    - `generator.py` (event generation)
    - `prompts.py` (prompt templates + types)
    - `slide_generation.py` (video slides)
    - `audio_generation.py` (audio TTS)
    - `genai_client.py` (Gemini client config)
- CLI runs end-to-end generation of video.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Test Full End-to-End CLI Run

- [x] Run `python daily_chronicle/main.py`
- [x] Verify:
    - [x] Event JSON saved
    - [x] 16 events are generated (not just 12)
    - [x] Images generated correctly
    - [x] Audio generated correctly
    - [x] Video written correctly
    - [x] Temporary files cleaned up

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ First Review Checkpoint: **Event JSON Editing**

**After initial event JSON is generated:**

- [x] Reject an event
- [x] Edit wording of an event or image_prompt

‚úÖ Complete for now ‚Äî see standing questions re: regeneration

---

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Second Review Checkpoint: **Image Review GUI**

**After images are generated:**

- [x] Regenerate an image
- [x] Replace an image (file picker or URL)
- [x] Reject event entirely (e.g., from 16 generated, only accept best 12)
- [x] Save reduced set of events to final event JSON
- [ ] Add progress spinner while regenerating images

---

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Prompt & Content Tuning

- [ ] Update `EVENT_GENERATION_PROMPT_TEMPLATE`:
    - [x] Ensure **1 of the 12 events is a famous birthday**
    - [x] Prompt-tune to **4th grade reading level** (currently tuned to 6th grade)
    - [x] Explicitly **discourage duplicate events**
    - [ ] Evaluate: should **image_prompt enhancement** be part of initial generation or a separate postprocessing step?

---

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ Speed & Optimization

- [x] Replace MoviePy `concatenate_videoclips` with optimized `ffmpeg` calls
    - [x] Research and implement `.txt`-based concat list
    - [x] Benchmark speed vs. current flow (target: <10 mins total runtime)

---

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Code Quality & Readability

- [ ] Add docstrings and inline comments for all major functions
- [ ] Improve readability across all modules
- [ ] Use `pathlib` instead of `os.path` for cross-platform compatibility

---

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ Add OpenAI API Support (Optional/Fallback)

- [x] Add support for OpenAI TTS via API key
- [x] Add support for OpenAI image generation via API key
- [x] Allow toggling Gemini vs OpenAI via config or CLI flag

---

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ Polish & UX Improvements

- [x] Improve video styling (typography, transitions, and pacing)
- [x] Save final reviewed `event.json` with the output `.mp4`
- [x] Image fail placeholder text needs to be notched down
- [x] Tune voice delivery:
    - [x] More **professorial**, **slower**, and in **lower vocal register**
- [x] Events should appear in **chronological order**, not generation order

---

### 9Ô∏è‚É£ Packaging for Non-Technical Users

- [ ] Create GUI frontend for easier use (PySide6/Tkinter)
- [ ] Route CLI stdout into scrollable textbox for debugging/log display
- [ ] Use **PyInstaller** to package the app as:
    - [ ] `.exe` on Windows (via Parallels)
    - [ ] `.app` on macOS
- [ ] Provide a clickable desktop icon or shortcut (e.g. via batch script or `.app` wrapper)

## üß† Standing Questions

- Should image prompts be enhanced during generation or via a separate enhancement function?
- Would birthday events benefit from a subtle animated confetti effect?
- Should i refactor the cleanup with iterdir() from pathlib?

## üå± Stretch Goals

- [ ] Birthday event: add celebratory confetti animation over slides
